    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hortobagyi pancake (crepe) or Hortobágyi palacsinta is one of the most popular dishes of traditional Hungarian cuisine. Hortobagyi pancake recipe is quite simple. Actually, it is a pancake with meat filling, served in sour cream and paprika sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Meat sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g minced pork</li>
        <li>1 pcs tomatoes roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 pcs green bell pepper peeled deseeded and sliced</li>
        <li>2 pcs onion peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>100 g sour cream</li>
        <li>3 pcs Garlic cloves chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon Salt</li>
        <li>a pinch Black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Sunflower Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pancake</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g Flour self-raising</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>100 ml Milk</li>
        <li>200 ml sparkling water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>a pinch sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sour Cream Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 ml sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Flour</li>
        <li>50 ml meat sauce strained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan and briefly fry the onion until it becomes translucent. Add the meat, salt and black pepper. Simmer until the meat gets a nice brown colour. Make sure that the meat does not have lumps so that it can be stuffed more easily later.</li>
        <li>Now add chopped tomatoes, parsley, paprika, garlic and pour 100 ml of water over everything. Simmer for a few minutes, until the water evaporates and finally add the sour cream. When the meat sauce is done take the sieve and strain the meat so that it separates from the sauce. Leave the meat on the side to cool, and let the sauce stay in the pan.</li>
        <li>While the meat sauce is cooking in a bowl, stir in the flour, eggs, milk and salt until you get a pancake mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake the pancakes in a pan for this purpose. For those who have never baked pancakes, it is necessary to pour a thin layer of the mixture over the surface of the pan. Bake over medium heat on each side for approx. 1 minute, until the pancakes start to turn brown. When one side is baked, turn and bake the other side, using a plastic spatula. Place the pancakes on a plate. From this mixture, you can make 8 pancakes.</li>
        <li>Divide the meat into 8 parts, fill the pancakes and fold them as in the picture. Place the pancakes in a pan, previously greased with a little oil.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the flour and sour cream and add it to the pan with the strained sauce. Mix everything well. Pour this sauce over the pancakes and put them in the oven to bake for approx. 20 minutes at 190 °C.</li>
        <li>Serve topped with sour cream and chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
